- Simple and lightweight, runs directly in the browser.
- Customizable for additional responses.

## Live Demo

> Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username after you upload the project to GitHub.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Type a message in the input box and click "Send".
3. The chatbot will respond based on predefined responses like:
    - "hi" → "Hello! How can I help you?"
    - "how are you" → "I'm doing great, thank you for asking!"
    - "bye" → "Goodbye! Have a nice day!"
    - For any other input, the bot will respond with: "Sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you try again?"
